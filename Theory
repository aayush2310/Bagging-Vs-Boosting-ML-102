1)Type of Model Used:-To achieve LB,LV there are 3 methods-Regularization,Bagging,Boosting
                      In bagging we take ML models having LB,HV like a fully grown decision tree
                      In boosting we take ML models having HB,LV like a decision stump.

2)Sequential Vs Parallel Learning:-In bagging the training of models take place parallely.In boosting it is sequential learning i.e model 1 is trained first then it gives 
its error to model 2 and so on.

3)Weightage of Base learners:-In bagging weitage is equal but in boosting it is not.
